hello my name is suchita. i have been learning python for 4 months. python is a very intersting coding language.
my experience in this field was interesting and fun at the same time i was learning a lot of things about this coding language.
it is like an extra language to learn outside of school in the free time. we made this game because of my friends and my mentors who are fans of bts.
so this is a simple guessing game. in this game you just have to guess who the next member is going to come.
there is also some info about the bts member who is currently there.
i had alot of fun making this game and also i would like to do more projects like this in the future.
